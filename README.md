# LocalZoo

Local zoo is a project I built over a weekend using Angular 2, Firebase, and REST API.

## Hosted documentation
https://local-zoo.firebaseapp.com/

## Project Requirements
* npm (node package manager) ($ brew install -g node)
* bower (front-end dependencies) ($ npm install -g bower)
* firebase (backend)
* angular cli ($ npm install -g angular-cli)

## General Setup
* npm install
* bower install
* setup firebase
* ng serve

## Firebase Setup

* Create an account with Firebase
* Create a new project
* Setup firebase for a web application
* Create a file called, api-keys.ts, in the app directory (app/api-keys.ts)
* Copy the example code below, and add in your credentials
* Once the api-keys.ts file is setup, you need to import the file into app.module.ts

## Firebase api-keys.ts code
```
export var masterFirebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  authDomain: "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  databaseURL: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  projectId: "xxxxxxxxxx",
  storageBucket: "xxxxxxxxx",
  messagingSenderId: "xxxxxxxxxxx"
};
```
